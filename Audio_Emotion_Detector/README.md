# Audio_Emotion_Detector

There are many projects on Text Emotion Detection and Text Sentiment Analysis, but I found that close to no work is done on detecton of emotion of audio samples. So, I decided to give it a try.   

## Dataset
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uldisvalainis/audio-emotions"> https://www.kaggle.com/uldisvalainis/audio-emotions</a>

This was a combiantion of following datasets:

• CREMA-D - 7,442 (58.15%)  

• TESS - 2,800 (21.88%)  

• RAVDESS 2,076 (16.22%)  

• SAVEE 480 (3.75%) The data set had a total of around 12,800 samples said in different emotion tone.  

## Models Trained
I selected 3 different algorithms to try. They are:

• Decision Tree  
• Convolutional Neural Networks   
• Multilayer perceptron
